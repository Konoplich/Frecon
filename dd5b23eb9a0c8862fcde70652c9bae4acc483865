      "message": "It seems like we should keep the behavior of not turning on non-main displays. But digging deeper, I see that disable_connector() makes the asumption that there is a 1:1 mapping between connectors and crtcs. If that isn\u0027t the case, then things could fail.\n\nSo I think the proper solution is to turn this into disable_non_main_crtcs() instead, which iterates over everything but the one crtc we want to use and turns them off.",
