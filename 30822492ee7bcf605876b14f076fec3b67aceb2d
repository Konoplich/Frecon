      "message": "Alternatively, there is already a `tty` group that\u0027s required to access the `/dev/pts/` files that `/run/frecon` symlinks to.   Since a user is required to be in that group already (to write to those symlinked files), I think it would be better to just change the ownership to the `tty` group for frecon also.  Otherwise, they have to be part of both groups, which increases the maintenance burden.",
